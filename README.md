# AllergyDelight

For our project, we created an app called AllergyDelight this is an app that helps people
who have food allergies and would be a quick and easy way to find their favourite foods in one
app that they can eat. For our development cycle, we chose to only add 3 restaurants due to time
constraints and only a few menu items. You can enter your chosen restaurant and filter out your
allergens and easily choose items you could eat. We also added pages so the user can go see the
location and contact or redirect the user to the restaurantâ€™s online ordering site. We created a
very user-friendly environment and a simple app so that it covers a big demographic. This app
idea is something new and we chose it as we did not see anything like or similar to it on the
market.

Please see Evaluation Report for a comprehensive insight.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio with the Xamarin development workload installed. You can download Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). During installation, make sure to select the "Mobile development with .NET" workload to install Xamarin.
- A physical device or emulator for testing. For iOS development, you will need a Mac with Xcode installed to run the iOS simulator or to deploy to an iOS device.

## Opening the Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Select "Open a project or solution" from the start window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing your Xamarin project (.sln file) and click "Open".

## Running the Project on Android

1. Set the Android project as the startup project by right-clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Set as Startup Project".
2. Connect an Android device to your computer via USB or start an Android emulator.
3. Select the device or emulator in the toolbar next to the run button.
4. Press the run button (green triangle) or press F5 to build and run the project on the selected device/emulator.

## Running the Project on iOS

1. Set the iOS project as the startup project by right-clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Set as Startup Project".
2. Connect an iOS device to your Mac or select an iOS simulator.
3. If using a Mac, ensure Visual Studio is connected to your Mac build host.
4. Select the device or simulator in the toolbar next to the run button.
5. Press the run button (green triangle) or press F5 to build and run the project on the selected device/simulator.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build or deployment errors:** Check the Output and Error List windows in Visual Studio for any specific error messages. Ensure all NuGet packages are up to date and compatible.
- **Device not recognized:** Ensure developer mode is enabled on your device and that you have installed any necessary drivers.
- **iOS build host connection issues:** Ensure your Mac and Windows machine are on the same network and that you've correctly configured the Mac build host in Visual Studio.
